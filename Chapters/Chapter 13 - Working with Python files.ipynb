The most common way to work with Python is actually to use .py files, which is why it is important that you know how to work with them. You can see python files as one cell in a notebook without any markdown."

Other options are [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) (for macOS) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (for Windows).
