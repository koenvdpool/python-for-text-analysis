    "Way to go! You have already learned a lot of essential components of the Python language. Being able to deal with data structures, import packages, build your own functions and operate with files is not only essential for most tasks in Python, but also a prerequisite for text analysis. We have applied some common preprocessing steps like casefolding/lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stemming/lemmatization. Did you know that there are some very useful NLP packages and modules that do some of these steps? One that is often used in text analysis is the Python package **NLTK (the Natural Language Toolkit)**.\n",

    "* have an idea of the NLP tasks that constitute an NLP pipeline\n",
    "* use the functions of the NLTK module to manipulate the content of files for NLP purposes (e.g. sentence splitting, tokenization, POS-tagging, and lemmatization);\n",
