    "In the subsequent chapters, we will introduce you to several data formats. In the previous chapters, you have already worked with plain text. Now, we are going to work with: \n",
    "\n",
    "* tables (CSV/TSV) \n",
    "* JSON\n",
    "* XML \n",
    "\n",
    "These formats are simply the result of agreements that were made between people on how to organize and store data. Some formats, such as XML and RDF, have a high degree of structure, whereas plain text is a typical example of unstructured data. Structuring data according to predefined specifications allows information in the data to be easily ordered and processed by machines. You can compare highly structured data with a perfectly organized filing cabinet where everything is identified, labeled, and easy to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, you can treat any of these data formats as a text file with certain regularities people have agreed on**. You can simply read in the file and use the tools you already to exploit these regularities and access information. For some data formats with rather complex structures (such as XML), it is more convenient to use existing python packages to extract information. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces tabular formats: CSV/TSV. TSV/CSV is a highly transparent way of structuring data in tables. It is a rather straightforward structure and does not necessarily require specific Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:**\n",
    "* read CSV/TSV data\n",
    "* manipulate CSV/TSV data\n",
    "* write CSV/TSV data\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to CSV and TSV (tables)\n",
    "The **table** is probably one of the most common and intuitive data formats. Undoubtedly, you have already worked with tabular data in Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets. A table represents a set of data points as a series of rows, with a column for each of the data points' properties. In other words: a table has vertical **columns** (often identifiable by name) and horizontal **rows**, and the **cells** are the unit where a row and column intersect. This is a very simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| name     | house      | patronus |  \n",
    "|----------|------------|----------| \n",
    "| Harry    | Gryffindor | stag     | \n",
    "| Hermione | Gryffindor | otter    | \n",
    "| Draco    | Slytherin  | unknown  | \n",
    "| Hannah   | Hufflepuff | unknown  | \n",
    "\n",
    "Tabular data can be encoded as **CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values)**. CSV and TSV files are simply plain text files in which each line represents a row, and the columns are separated by a comma (for CSV) or a tab character (for TSV).\n",
