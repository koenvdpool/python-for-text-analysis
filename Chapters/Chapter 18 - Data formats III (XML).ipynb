    "In this chapter, we will learn how to work with one of the most popular structured data formats: [XML](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/). XML is used a lot in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and it is important that you know how to work with it. In theory, you could load XML data just as you read in a text file, but the structure is much too complicated to extract information manually. Therefore, we use an existing library. \n",

For example, `Apply_heat` has relations with the `Absorb_heat`, `Cooking_creation` and `Intentionally_affect` frames. In FrameNet, frame descriptions are stored in XML format.\n",
